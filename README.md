🚀 React Snippet Manager is a simple yet powerful Bash-based tool that helps you store, search, and copy reusable React, Next.js, and TypeScript snippets across projects. Instead of manually searching for your custom hooks, utilities, or components in old projects, use this tool to quickly fetch and integrate them into your current project.

✨ Features:
✅ Centralized Snippet Storage – Organize your snippets in a dedicated repository.
✅ Quick Search & Copy – Find and copy snippets by name or keyword in seconds.
✅ Seamless Integration – Easily move snippets into your React/Next.js projects.
✅ Fuzzy Search (Planned) – Speed up searches with fzf for an even smoother experience.
✅ Git Backup (Planned) – Sync your snippets with GitHub for access anywhere.

💡 How It Works:
1️⃣ List Available Snippets
2️⃣ Search & Select a Snippet
3️⃣ Copy It to Your Current Project

🚀 Simplify your workflow & never lose track of your code snippets again!
