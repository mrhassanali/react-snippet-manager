ðŸš€ React Snippet Manager is a simple yet powerful Bash-based tool that helps you store, search, and copy reusable React, Next.js, and TypeScript snippets across projects. Instead of manually searching for your custom hooks, utilities, or components in old projects, use this tool to quickly fetch and integrate them into your current project.
